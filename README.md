This project was a contest on Freelancer.com

The client wanted an email newsletter to advertise their children's summer camp in Florida.

The limited email format forced me to design the newsletter with tables which was interesting. 
I learned that that was how they designed websites back in the 90's.

I did not end up uploading my submission since a winner was chosen as I was working on it.
